# tlua
Lua with a ncurses TUI

## 2026 - Repository Archived.
I may make a new version some time, however look at manualbind to see how my C++/Lua 
binding code turned out, and it also has some performance and bug fixes over the code
here.

My experiments with making a Lua console with support for yielding, and separate output.

Aiming for UTF-8 compatibility - or at least so I can write Spanish and Turkish strings :-)

This will also be a test harness for C++ binding methods.
